"""Scripted (hand-coded) cogame-moba player: ``python -m players.scripted_player``.

A per-hero finite-state lane-push bot, written as a legible reference
policy (Task 6.2b) — not a tuning contest entry. Structure borrows from
the coworld-ctf baseline bot: perception is parsed into an explicit
state struct, a small persistent world model sits on top of the raw
observation (static nav grid + cost fields, dead-tower memory), roles
are deterministic from the hero identity, and steering is separated
from mode selection.

Ground truth for every constant below is the vendored upstream source,
``vendor/upstream/moba.h`` (line numbers cited per table).

Observation contract (compute_observations, moba.h:460-533)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Each hero gets 510 bytes: a 484-byte "crop" region then 26 self bytes.

Self bytes (obs[484:510], moba.h:480-503): x, y, level, health*10/max,
mana*10/max, damage/50, move_speed, move_modifier (int-cast: slow 0.5
reads as 0), stun/move/q/w/e/basic-attack timers, basic cd, is_hit,
team, hero one-hot at 17+hero_type, and four reward-event flags.

Crop reliability — the stride-1 overlap quirk (moba.h:505-531): the
crop is written per cell at ``map_idx = (dy+5)*11 + (dx+5)`` — stride
1, not 4 — so indices run 0..120 while the buffer holds 484 bytes.
For each cell the tile id is written at ``map_idx`` and, if an entity
occupies the cell, health/mana/level at ``map_idx+1..3`` — which are
exactly the *tile* slots of the next three cells. Cells are visited in
increasing ``map_idx`` order, so every tile write at index i happens
AFTER any earlier cell's entity bytes landed on index i and clobbers
them. Conclusion, relied on throughout this module:

- bytes 0..120 are ALWAYS the 121 tile ids of the 11x11 crop
  (row-major, row = dy+5, col = dx+5, center = self);
- entity health/mana/level survive ONLY for the last cell (indices
  121..123, bottom-right corner) — useless, ignored;
- bytes 124..483 are never written (memset zero, moba.h:462).

So the crop yields tile-id presence only: which tile types sit where
around us. Tile ids (moba.h:28-43): EMPTY 0, WALL 1, TOWER 2 (team NOT
encoded — resolved against the static tower table via our absolute
position), RADIANT_CREEP 3, DIRE_CREEP 4, NEUTRAL 5, radiant heroes
6..10, dire heroes 11..15.

Action contract (step_players, moba.h:1503-1545)
------------------------------------------------
[vel_y, vel_x, attack_target, use_q, use_w, use_e], each 0..ACT_HIGH-1.
Velocity decodes as (a-3)/3, dest = pos + move_modifier*speed*vel with
speed 1.0 (sim/shim_common.h:17-18); move_to fails silently into
non-empty cells — players get NO pathfinding, hence the client-side
nav grid. attack_target 0/1 scan ALL hostiles (creeps, neutrals,
heroes, towers) in the vision square (radius 5); 2 scans heroes+towers
only (moba.h:1519-1525). The engine self-selects the NEAREST scanned
entity as the target for skills and basic attacks; skill flags are
tried Q, then W, then E, then basic attack (moba.h:1533-1541) and a
failed skill (cooldown/mana/target-type) falls through harmlessly.

Mode machine (per hero)
-----------------------
- PUSH: follow the hero's lane waypoints (WAYPOINTS, moba.h:71-72)
  toward the enemy ancient. Lanes mirror the engine's own hero lane
  assignment (init_moba, moba.h:1667-1744): support/carry mid-bot
  lane 2, assassin/burst lane 1, tank lane 0 (+3 for dire). Steering
  is a BFS cost field over the embedded static wall grid (derived from
  vendor/upstream/game_map.h; sha256 ec17403c...), descending one
  8-connected step per tick exactly like the engine's own bfs atn map.
- SIEGE HOLD (inside PUSH): towers scan at the same radius as heroes
  (TOWER_VISION 5, moba.h:45 — no out-ranging) but hit for 110-175 per
  shot (moba.h:65), an order of magnitude over a hero basic attack, so
  diving one without a creep wave soaking its shots is a fast death.
  When a live enemy tower is within its scan radius and no friendly
  creep wave is engaged on it, back off and wait for creeps. Ancients
  are exempt (TOWER_DAMAGE 0 for both, moba.h:65): they cannot shoot,
  so the endgame dive is free. Tower liveness is
  a small world model: a tower whose known cell is visible in the crop
  without a TOWER tile is remembered dead (kill_entity's body zeroes
  the grid cell, moba.h:632-633; called on tower death from attack,
  moba.h:735-737).
- RETREAT: health <= 3/10 sends the hero toward its own fountain
  (spawn, moba.h:1636-1643); passive +2/tick regen (moba.h:1468-1475)
  heals it; hysteresis exits at >= 8/10 so it cannot oscillate.
  Death needs no special mode: the engine respawns instantly at the
  fountain with full health (attack -> spawn_player, moba.h:723-728);
  a position teleport just resets waypoint tracking to the nearest
  waypoint. Rushers (below) use a much tighter 1/10 -> 4/10 band:
  since death is an instant full-heal teleport home, a rusher walking
  home at low health only loses race time.
- DEFEND (dire only, shared alarm): heroes report enemy-hero
  sightings near the own ancient into seat-shared state. A single
  sighting within 30 cells of the ancient, or >= 2 distinct enemy
  heroes within 45 cells in one tick (a grouped dive), arms a 90-tick
  alarm; while it is armed, dire heroes within 60 cells of the own
  ancient (and healthy enough, or already levelled past 10) rally on
  the ancient so the base towers back the fight. This exists because
  the pretrained baseline wins by 5-hero ancient dives that a pure
  lane-push FSM never answers. Radiant plays the classic v1 lane push
  bit-identically: on that side the FSM already beat the baseline
  100% of the time, and league A/B showed the extra machinery only
  hurt against rivals that keep lane pressure up.
- RUSH (dire only): the map and the pretrained baseline are radiant-
  favored — measured head-to-head, baseline-as-radiant group-dives
  the dire ancient by tick ~1300 while a symmetric lane push cracks
  the radiant base only by tick ~2100+, so dire always loses that
  race. Instead of racing on the baseline's terms, dire exploits two
  vendored facts: attacks land at L1 range <= 12 (moba.h:686-689)
  while both tower scan and player scan reach only chebyshev 5, and
  ancients deal no damage and never regenerate (moba.h:65, 1422-1425
  commented out). Cells therefore exist that poke the enemy ancient
  risk-free (POKE below), and a Dijkstra route over the wall grid
  (RUSH_ROUTE) reaches dire's poke cell while entering tower range on
  only 3 cells (~one 175-damage shot on the sprint through). The
  assassin, tank and carry take that route and grind the ancient
  down; the burst stays on its mid lane so the lanes are not entirely
  free-fed, and the support garrisons the own ancient as a sentinel
  to spot and stall dives (towers plus fountain proximity). Opponents
  cannot even observe their own ancient's health (it is not in the
  obs contract), so a backdoor race is structurally hard to answer.
  Radiant keeps the classic lane push, which already beats the
  baseline 100% of the time on that side.
- RUSH ABORT: racing is only right against opponents that do not race
  back. League rivals win as radiant by streaming heroes over the
  top-edge corridor into the dire base from tick ~150; any enemy hero
  sighted in that corridor (y <= 24, x >= 35) or on our ancient
  within the first 600 ticks flips dire permanently back to classic
  v1 lane play (its league floor against exactly those rivals). The
  pretrained baseline's earliest base arrivals are ~tick 1000+, so
  passive-baseline games never abort. The sentinel garrisons a
  north-entrance watchpost covering the observed conveyor entry,
  rallying to the ancient while a dive alarm is active.
- STUCK detour: creeps and heroes block cells; if position hasn't
  moved for a few ticks the desired step is rotated 90 degrees
  (alternating side) for a few ticks to slide around blockers.
  Dire instead sweeps all 8 engine step directions (5 ticks each)
  until the position actually changes: rotating a blocked diagonal
  explores only its two perpendiculars, which can all be blocked
  (walls plus float-truncated move_to), and league replays showed
  heroes frozen that way at one cell for thousands of ticks. A dire
  hero blocked 8+ ticks also switches to the scan-everything filter
  so entity plugs (neutral camps, creep scrums) get attacked clear.

Skills (moba.h:1151-1362) are fired by per-role rules on the engine's
Q->W->E priority chain; the target filter is 0 (everything) when
hostile creeps are visible — lane-clearing XP — else 2 (heroes+towers)
so sieging focuses towers and idle neutrals camps are not aggroed.

Determinism: pure function of (obs bytes, per-hero state). No RNG and
no clocks; COGAME_PLAYER_SEED is accepted for interface parity but
unused. Works for 1-hero and 5-hero seats: hero identity (team, hero
type) is read from each obs row, per-hero state is keyed by row index.
